# What it does, in order: ask GitHub for the latest release, download the one
# archive for this machine, check its SHA256 against the checksums published in
# the same release, unpack it somewhere inside your home directory, and tell you
# where. It never asks for sudo, never writes outside the paths it prints, and
# touches nothing else.
